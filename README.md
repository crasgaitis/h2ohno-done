_Detecting & Reporting Water Contamination_

**Contamination Types:**
* Lead
* Copper
* Rust (Iron)
* Sewage

**Features:**
* ML model to determine type of contamination from image
* Chatbot from Google Cloud's DialogFlow to enter descriptions of water, certain trigger words match with contamination types. Also, users can ask about specific contamination types and their health effects
* Google Maps (Google Cloud) to pin contamination reports via location. If many pins with the same contamination point are plotted in the same area, it may suggest a bigger issue, such as a single contaminated water supply.
* Data visualization with chart.js to track overall improvement in water accessibility
